    <p>An NGO (Non-Governmental Organization) is a non-profit organization that operates independently of the government to address social, environmental, or humanitarian issues. NGOs work towards the welfare of society by providing education, healthcare, disaster relief, and support to marginalized communities. They rely on donations, grants, and volunteers to carry out their activities and often play a crucial role in advocating for human rights, sustainable development, and social justice. By bridging the gap between the government and the people, NGOs contribute significantly to creating a more equitable and compassionate society.</p>
